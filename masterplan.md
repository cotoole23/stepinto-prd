## Product Vision

**Step Into** is a beautifully minimalist mobile app that lets tourists explore heritage towns like Cobh, Ireland, through immersive, story-rich walking tours—at their own pace, fully offline after download.  
We blend cultural storytelling, simple UX, and GPS-based navigation to connect travelers with local history and place—making discovery flexible, affordable, and deeply meaningful.

---

## Product Objectives

- **Empower independent tourists** to explore towns in a way that’s authentic, flexible, and personal—no rigid group tours, no data needed after download.
- **Support local businesses and heritage** by driving footfall to lesser-known spots and providing a platform for cultural storytelling.
- **Scale easily** to new towns and languages with a repeatable content and tech playbook.

---

## Target Users

- Independent travelers (age 25–70) visiting Irish towns—especially solo tourists, couples, day-trippers, and cruise passengers.
- Visitors seeking authentic stories, local culture, architecture, and scenic exploration.
- Users with limited mobile data, international roaming, or spotty coverage (offline-first needs).
- Spontaneous explorers discovering the app via QR code at arrival points or local signage.
