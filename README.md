# Step Into – Product Requirements Documentation

Welcome to the **Step Into PRD repository** — the single source of truth for the Step Into mobile app, an offline-first walking tour platform for cultural exploration in towns like Cobh, Ireland.

## Key Principles

- **Offline-First:**  
  Tours, maps, and content must be fully usable offline after initial download.
- **Minimalist, Intuitive UX:**  
  No clutter. Clear actions. Guided flows. Inspired by Airbnb, Roadtrippers, and Hopper.
- **Cultural Storytelling:**  
  Prioritize local history, voices, and heritage preservation.
- **Privacy-Respecting:**  
  No logins, no personal data collected in MVP.

## Out of Scope (MVP)

Some features are **deferred** for future releases (see each doc for details), including:
- User accounts and cross-device purchase recovery
- Audio narration
- Multi-language support
- Multiple towns/tours beyond Cobh
- Push notifications and marketing features
